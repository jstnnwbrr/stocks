The upgrade came even as the firm lowered its price target on the stock to $425 from $480. Analysts pointed to the stock's significant decline of over 39% year-to-date, which brought it near a 52-week low. That slump followed mixed fourth-quarter results and a weak earnings forecast that worried investors. However, UBS argued the negative reaction was excessive. The firm believed the market underestimated how essential FactSet's products are and noted the company's ability to quickly integrate Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology, countering fears of disruption.

The latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) report showed a 3.0% year-over-year increase, slightly below the 3.1% that analysts had expected. This moderation in inflation is a significant signal for investors, suggesting that price pressures may be easing. For the tech sector, which is often sensitive to interest rate changes, this news was particularly welcome. Softer inflation could give the Federal Reserve the flexibility to pause or even begin cutting interest rates.
